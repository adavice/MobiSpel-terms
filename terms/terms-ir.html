              Welcome to Mobispel at
              <a href="http://www.playme-games.com">www.playme-games.com</a>
              (the "Website"). Read these terms and conditions (the "Terms and
              Conditions") carefully. If you do not accept these terms, do not
              continue on this site with registration or with any attempt to
              access or use the services covered by these terms. Otherwise, you
              agree to use the Services in accordance with the terms of this
              Agreement. We may need to change these terms from time to time and
              such changes will be made in accordance with these terms. Please
              check this site regularly as we will notify you of such changes
              here. The services are provided to you via your mobile operator.
              The terms of use for your mobile operator also apply to the

            <h2 class="terms-heading">GENERAL PROVISIONS</h2>
            <p>
              The Service provides content for entertainment purposes only. We
              reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify
              portions of these Terms at any time. If we do this, we will post
              the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page
              the date these Terms were last revised. Any such changes will
              become effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service
              after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your
              acceptance of the new Terms. If any provision of these terms of
              use shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason is unenforceable,
              then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms of
              use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
              remaining provisions. If you breach these terms of use and we take
              no action against you, we will not be considered to have given up
              our rights in respect of your breach and we will also still be
              entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation
              where you breach these terms of use. Except where expressly
              provided to the contrary, these terms of use are not intended to
              be for the benefit of, and shall not be enforceable by, any person
              who is not a party to it, under any applicable laws or otherwise,
              except that any of our group undertakings may enforce any
              provision of these terms of use as if it were a part to them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="terms-heading">FEES</h2>
            <p>
              Mobile subscription service Mobispel provides access to the
              game portal ie.wowcontents.com for a price of €7.50 per week for
              unlimited access to the content. The service is delivered to you
              via your mobile operator. The terms of use for your mobile
              operator also apply to the delivery and billing of the services.
              The fees are due regardless of whether you actually use any
              content; the consideration for the fees is only the provision of
              the right to use, receive and/or access mobile entertainment
              content. The periodic fee is charged for each subscription period
              to which the agreement applies. You must pay for access to the
              services and their use in accordance with the price lists that
              apply to your order through your mobile operator. Unless otherwise
              stated, the charges are billed by your mobile carrier on your
              cordless phone bill or deducted from your prepaid balance in
              accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to your mobile
              carrier. Additional taxes and separate fees charged for text
              messaging and/or data transmission may apply to your registration
              and/or use of the Services under the terms of your mobile operator
              or provider. All fees, including fees for existing subscription
              agreements, are subject to change upon notice from the company
              and/or your mobile operator. Such a change gives you reasonable
              notice. If you do not accept the new fees (which will only apply
              in the future), you can cancel your subscription, and/or your
              account will take effect immediately after the termination.
            </p>

            <h2 class="terms-heading">TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>
              If you regret and wish to terminate the subscription, send STOP to
              57976 or contact us at <strong>support@mobispel.com</strong>.
              These terms of use are effective from the date you first visit the
              website or use Content and shall continue in effect until
              terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these terms of
              use at any time by discontinuing use of the Site and destroying
              all materials obtained from the Site and all related documentation
              and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under these
              terms of use or otherwise. We may immediately terminate these
              terms of use with respect to you (including your access to the
              Site) at our absolute discretion including, without limitation, if
              you breach or fail to comply with any material term or provision
              of these terms of use. Upon termination, you must cease use of the
              Site and destroy all materials obtained from the Site and all
              copies thereof, whether made under these terms of use or
              otherwise. We have adopted and implemented a policy that provides
              for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the accounts
              of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property
              rights. Any fraudulent, abusive or otherwise illegal activity may
              also be grounds for termination of your account, at our sole
              discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement
              agencies.
